<h2 align="center">Hey there! My name is Adam. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“</h2>

<p align="center">I'm a Backend Software Developer with interests in C#, .NET Core, Apache NiFi, mobile development (Xamarin/React Native), and cloud software platforms.
I also have a weak spot for Serif font faces with a focus on high legibility of text on computer screens. Some might say I'm a slight bit obsessed with DNS infrastructure as well.</p>

### ðŸ’» Notable Projects

I've built a few products for the Internet through my own company, [Octane Software](https://www.octanesoftware.net) like a web hosting company for ambitious digital experiences ([MojoEngine](https://www.mojoengine.com)) and the world's first third-level domain registry ([Resolve Zero](https://resolvezero.com)). Some notable projects I've created or contributed to on GitHub include:

- ðŸš€ [Xamarin.Forms Video Player](https://github.com/adamfisher/Xamarin.Forms.VideoPlayer) - a cross-platform video player for Xamarin.Forms developers (700+ copies sold ðŸ’°)
- ðŸš€ [Apache NiFi](https://github.com/apache/nifi) created the `DetectDuplicateRecord` processor block using Google's Bloom Filter implementation to efficiently detect duplicates with finite memory.
